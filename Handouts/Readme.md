Additional materials created by TAs, students and instructor.

We already have a few interesting animations made by Anirban:
* Effect of noise on Regression
* How KNN selects nearest neighbors and why it produces jumps?

We have simiplified versions of notebooks for chapters of Hands on ML book.

Students can submit PR for their work here for the suggested practice exercises in Class.
