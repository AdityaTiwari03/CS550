# DataAnalyticsAndVisualization
Course Page for DS250 (Data Analytics and Visualization) being taught at [IIT Bhilai, India](https://www.iitbhilai.ac.in/index.php) in the Winter Semester of 2022.
<br> Course Instructor: [Dr. Gagan Raj Gupta ](https://www.iitbhilai.ac.in/index.php?pid=gagan)

The purpose of this course is to introduce students to various algorithms and techniques for data analysis and visualization. We will emphasize visualization and analysis of complex data sets such as large network data. 

We will cover some very basic topics necessary for handling large data, such as hashing, sorting, graphs, data structures, and databases. We will then move to more advanced data analysis topics: clustering, classification, mining of frequent itemsets, graph mining, visualization

The project and lab component of this course will equip students with modern software toolkit to develop their own data analysis and interactive visualization applications (web/andrioid) to better appreciate the data science process.

Motivation
----------
* Useful insights can be obtained from data that can help people: healthcare, industry, governments, science
* Getting data is becoming easier day by day, but is very complex and difficult for people to understand
* Data has _errors_ of various types (missing, incorrect etc.), is _incomplete_ and is _hard to clean_ (e.g. user reviews/ratings, distorted images) 
* Data usually has _complex correlations_ and i.i.d. assumptions don't always work very well (e.g. graph data, time-series data) 
* Data Visualization is critical to help us engage more diverse audience in the process of analytical thinking 

__We are often asked to answer difficult questions from this messy data__

__We have to make decisions (often in real-time)__. 

In this course, we want to learn how that is being done and solve real-life problems that we are interested in.

Course Objectives
-----------------
* Motivate and demonstrate the benefits and uses of data science  
* Develop a strong __mathematical foundation__ (linear algebra, statistics, optimization), needed for understanding and implementing the important data analysis and ML algorithms
* Teach fundamental algorithms for handling basic and complex datasets including __streaming algorithms__
* Study techniques for creating effective visualizations based on principles from graphic design, perceptual psychology, and cognitive science
* Teach basic techniques of ML
* Provide hands-on experience to students in analyzing datasets in diverse fields __(NLP, Image/Video, Graphs, Networks, Bio-informatics, Finance)__

Pre-requisites
--------------
* Basic knowledge of Python (most assignments will be based on Python)
* Knowledge of basic computer science principles and skills
* Math
  * Linear Algebra ( Matrix-factorization, Eigenvalues, Column and row spaces, Norms)
  * Probability theory (Conditional, Bayes Rule, Concentration Inequalities, Distributions, Gaussian, Multi-variate) 
  * Basic Data Structures, Algorithms and Asymptotic Analysis (graphs, heaps, lists, dynamic programming)
  * Calculus (Multi-variate)
  
If you don't meet one or more pre-requisites, be prepared to spend more time before or during the course in learning them.
