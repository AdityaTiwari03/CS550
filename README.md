# Machine Learning
Course Page for CS550 (Machine Learning) to be taught at [IIT Bhilai, India](https://www.iitbhilai.ac.in/index.php) in the Monsoon Semester of 2023.
<br> Course Instructor: [Dr. Gagan Raj Gupta ](https://www.iitbhilai.ac.in/index.php?pid=gagan)
<br> Office Location: ED1 Room 412


**Motivation and Objectives**
-----------------------------
Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that automatically improve their performance through experience (e.g., programs that learn to recognize objects, Analyze sentiments, recommend music and movies, and drive autonomous robots). This course covers the theory and practical algorithms for machine learning from a variety of perspectives. 

Topics include: 
* Supervised Learning (Regression/Classification), Linear models: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Generalized Linear Models, Support Vector Machines, Nonlinearity and Kernel Methods, Multi-class/Structured Outputs, Ranking/Grading
* Evaluating Machine Learning algorithms and Model Selection, Ensemble Methods (Boosting, Bagging, Random Forests), Sparse Modeling and Estimation, 
* Unsupervised Learning, Clustering: K-means/Kernel K-means, Dimensionality Reduction: PCA and kernel PCA, Matrix Factorization and Matrix Completion, 
* Generative Models (mixture models and latent factor models), Diffusion models, GAN, (Variational) Autoencoders
* Assorted Topics: learning theory (bias/variance tradeoffs, practical advice) 
* Deep Learning and Feature Representation Learning: CNN, RNN, GNN

The course will also discuss recent machine-learning applications, such as computer vision, medical imaging, time-series mining, bioinformatics, web and industrial data processing.

Programming assignments include hands-on experiments with various learning algorithms. This course is designed to give a graduate-level student a thorough grounding in the methodologies, technologies, mathematics, and algorithms currently needed by people researching machine learning.

**Learning Outcomes**
---------------------
* Implement and analyze existing learning algorithms, including well-studied methods for classification, regression, structured prediction, clustering, and representation learning
* Integrate multiple facets of practical machine learning in a single system: data preprocessing, learning, regularization, and model selection
* Describe the formal properties of models and algorithms for learning and explain the practical implications of those results
* Compare and contrast different paradigms for learning (supervised, unsupervised, etc.)
* Design experiments to evaluate and compare different machine learning techniques on real-world problems
* Employ probability, statistics, calculus, linear algebra, and optimization in order to develop new predictive models or learning methods
* Given a description of an ML technique, analyze it to identify 
     1. the expressive power of the formalism; 
     2. the inductive bias implicit in the algorithm; 
     3. the size and complexity of the search space; 
     4. the computational properties of the algorithm: 
     5. any guarantees (or lack thereof) regarding termination, convergence, correctness, accuracy or generalization power.

Grading Policy
--------------
The grading policy has been designed to give students as much hands-on practice while ensuring the fundamentals are strong.
Students who are first to submit PRs for correct solutions to assignments/homework will receive Class Participation credits (bonus)
* Mid-sem Exam: 25%
* Theory/Conceptual Homework: 10% 
* Programming Assignments: 30%
* Major Project: 25% 
* Surprise Quiz(es):  10%  (5 in-class/lab assessments, typically after every segment). You won't get any prior intimation.

3 assignments (Scaled up to a total of 600 points) 
-----------------------------------------------------
Asg 1: Regression + Classification

Optional Concepts: Random Forests, Boosting, Mixing Models, 

Asg 2: Image Classification and Segmentation
Concepts: CNN architectures, Transfer Learning, Model customization, Regularization, Trade-off between model size and accuracy

Asg 3: Generative Models

Groups Policy
-------------
* Students are encouraged to discuss homework and assignments with each other, but the submissions have to be original. If we find plagiarism, your grade will be reduced to D or F. 
* Assignments will be individual effort only
* Major Project can be done in groups of 2 or 3 with appropriate justification

Late submission policy
----------------------
* Every homework and/or assignment will have plenty of time to complete. There will be no late days allowed for any homework/assignment/project deadline.
* Students are encouraged to make regular submissions to Canvas portal and not wait for the last minute.
* In exceptional circumstances, the student can seek the instructor's permission for skipping/late submission of an assignment. This will be done MAX one time for any student in the semester.

Attendance Policy
-----------------
* Students are expected to attend each class and lab session. There will be surprise quizzes and attendance may also be taken.
* If a student has attendance less than 75% in the lecture component, they will not be allowed to appear for the exam.

Pre-requisites
--------------
Students entering the class are expected to have a pre-existing working knowledge of probability, linear algebra, statistics and algorithms, though the class has been designed to allow students with a strong numerate background to catch up and fully participate. 

* Programming experience in a general programming language. Specifically, you need to have written from scratch programs consisting of few hundred lines of code. 
Note: For each programming assignment, you will be required to use Python. You will be expected to know, or be able to quickly pick up, that programming language.

* Basic familiarity with probability and statistics: (Conditional probability, Bayes Rule, Random variable, independence, conditional independence, Expectation, Variance, Concentration Inequalities, Distributions, Gaussian, Multi-variate)
  
* Linear Algebra: Vectors and matrices, inner product, projection, Basis, (complete, orthonormal), Orthogonality, linear (in)dependence
eigenvalues and eigenvectors; singular values and vectors; SVD

* Discrete mathematics: (Proofs, Induction, Logic, Combinatorics, Graphs)

* You must strictly adhere to these pre-requisites! Even if IIT Bhilai's registration system does not prevent you from registering for this course, it is still your responsibility to make sure you have all of these prerequisites before you register.
